# VanillaJsRouter

A minimal router made with vanilla JS. Handled with hash changes. Used ES6 wherever possible. No JQuery at all.

## Limitations

Routing is handled with hash changes. Might try doing it with any URL change in the future.

## Notes

-   This might only work with newer browsers (Due to the use of ES6 features)
-   The navbar can be its own 'page' if you'd prefer a more components based page
